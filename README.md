# League Alerts Web Application
Project for all 3rd Year Students. In this project we all had to find an external client that was willing for us to try and implement its own unique web application. My friends and i chose league alerts, a sports media company that is very popular on socila media platforms such as X and instagram.

## Codebase
Inside this project we used `Spring Boot Java` for the backend and `gradle` for dependency management. For the frontend we used `React JS`.  The database we chose to use was `mongodb`. This project was without a doubt the most challenging  for my team and I. I never would have though being that young we would accomplished what we had acheived.
